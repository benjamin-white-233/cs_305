Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that needed to improve security of their web interface.  For a financial services, data security is critical for the trust of their customers. 

In this assignment, I produced a vulnerability report and refactored code for the web application to improve security of the application.
A combination of reviewing code and dependency vulnerability mitigation was used to improve the security of Artemis Financial's web appication.  

In particular, I implemented a self-signed certificate, changed web protocol to HTTPS, and implemented a SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt user-supplied data in transit.
